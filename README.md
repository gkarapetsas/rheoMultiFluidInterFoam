# rheoMultiFluidInterFoam

Description
===========

The rheoMultiFluidInterFoam is a new control volume solver that can be used for the simulation of non-Newtonian n-phase flows (n>=2), fully accounting for interfacial tension and contact-angle effects for each phase. 

The rheoMultiFluidInterFoam solver which is capable of fully taking into account complex non-Newtonian effects (e.g. yield stress, viscoelasticity, etc.) of the involved liquids. To this end, the developed solver incorporates the RheoTool toolbox (Pimenta and Alves, 2017), utilizing a wealth of constitutive equations suitable for modeling different types of fluids with complex rheology.
